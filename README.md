In this project, we address the issue of determining the winner of an electoral process. In an electoral process, each participant can declare their candidacy for the election and/or vote for a declared candidate. Electoral processes have historically raised challenging questions about trust and transparency, as elections are typically organized by the incumbent executive system, which is often a candidate for re-election and therefore suspected of interference. Additionally, the counting of votes involves poll workers, making it a time-consuming process with limited reliability since not everyone can verify that the count was conducted honestly. Furthermore, the anonymity of paper ballots means that no one can verify afterward whether their vote was counted for the correct candidate.

Another aspect to consider is the user-friendliness for voters. Specifically, a decentralized system would enable remote voting, which has long been considered a tool to combat voter abstention, which reached historic levels in the June 2021 regional and departmental elections in France (66.7% overall and up to 87% among those under 25). A bill was also submitted to the National Assembly on September 21, 2021, to allow postal voting. This bill represents a first step towards electronic voting, with the main argument being that postal voting has been in place in Germany since 1957, potentially justifying the difference in voter turnout between France and Germany (where it does not exceed 33%).

The objective of this project is to propose a framework for considering the protocols and data structures to effectively implement the process of designating the election winner while ensuring the integrity, security, and transparency of the election.
